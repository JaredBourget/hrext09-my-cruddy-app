 ### Advanced Reqs
- [ ] Item that I added goes here...

Fueled by a recent trip to Moab Utah and a terrible bike rental experience, I would like to 
create a web app for inventory management and rentals across participating bike shops. 

Some of the relevant actors would be: 
	1. The participating bike shops.
	2. The availability of the bike/gear across the shops.
	3. The persons renting.
	4. Location and price of gear

The bike shops would need to have a collective inventory of bikes and gear. 
	Bike inventory considerations:
		1. Size
		2. Type - mountain or road? 
		3. Suspension - full or hard tail?
		4. Wheel diameter - 27.5" or 29"? What about fat tires? 
		5. Pedals - Clip or platform? 
		6. Features - Dropper post? Disc Brakes?
		7. Brand
		8. Price
	Helmet inventory considerations:
		1. Size
		2. Color
		3. Brand
		4. Price
	Clothing inventory considerations:
		1. Gloves - size, style (full or finger-less), and color
		2. Shammy - size 

For the persons viewing and renting bikes and gear.
	Rental considerations:
		1. Name
		2. Contact information - phone number or email
		3. Drivers License number and State/Country

The basic requirements of the app would need to include:
		1. Ability to add/remove bikes and gear from list based on availability 
		2. When a person rents equipment, the equipment needs to be linked 
		   with the person and their information. For my purposes, it might be
		   accomplished by a rental shopping cart, which on checkout, requires the information
		   of the renter. Once submitted, the items in the cart would be removed from the 
		   list of available rentals.
		3. Shows the prices and locations of the rental gear
